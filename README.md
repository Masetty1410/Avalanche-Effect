**DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARD** <br/>
<br/>
The Data Encryption Standard is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data.<br/><br/>
DES is a **block cipher** and encrypts data in blocks of size of 64 bits each, which means 64 bits of plain text goes as the input to DES, which produces 64 bits of ciphertext. The same algorithm and key are used for encryption and decryption, with minor differences. The key length is 56 bits.<br/><br/>
In this repository plaintexts and keys are generated using hamming distance method and garphs are plotted against Hamming distance and Round number for 2 instances:<br/>
a)Plaintexts are generated by hamming distances and graph is plotted for single key each at a time <br/>
b)a)Keys are generated by hamming distances and graph is plotted for single plaintext each at a time.
